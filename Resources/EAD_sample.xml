            <head>Biography</head>
            <p>Mildred Ellen Davenport was a noted civic official and military officer with an
            extensive career as a dancer and dance instructor in Boston in the 1930s and 1940s. She
            was born in Boston on November 12, 1900. She began her dance studies at C.C. Perkins
            Grade School and Prince School as a teenager, and graduated from Boston Girls' High
            School in 1918. In the 1920s she studied at the Sargent School for Physical Culture and
            at Harvard, and opened her first dance school, the Davenport School of Dance. Over the
            next ten years she studied under Ted Shawn and taught dance in Boston. She was also
            progressively more involved in road show performances such as Hot Chocolates. From 1930
            to 1935 she performed in a number of African-American musical productions on Broadway,
            including Fast and Furious, Flying Colors, and Black Birds. In 1932 she established her
            second dance school, the Silver Box Studio, in the South End of Boston. She became the
            first African American woman to perform with the Arthur Fiedler Pops unit of the Boston
            Symphony Orchestra at this time.</p>
            <p>During World War II, Davenport enlisted in the Army as a captain. She produced
            musical shows for military bases and later served as a special service officer, library
            officer, and advisor in the Office of Racial Affairs. In 1950, she served as an
            executive board member for the N.A.A.C.P. office in Boston. From 1947 to 1968 she worked
            for the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, founded in 1944 to enforce fair
            employment practices. Davenport died in Boston in 1990.</p>

        <head id="a2">BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF GOVERNOR WILLIS A. GORMAN</head>
        <p>Willis Arnold Gorman was born in Kentucky on January 12, 1816. His early career was
        as a lawyer and state legislator (Democrat) in Indiana. During the Mexican War he raised and
        commanded an Indiana rifle battalion and an infantry regiment, and subsequently was elected
        to two terms in the U.S. Congress. President Franklin Pierce appointed him Governor of
        Minnesota in May 13, 1853, and he served in that office until 1857. He was subsequently a
        delegate to the state constitutional convention (1857) and was elected to the first state
        legislature (1858).</p>
        <p>At the outset of the Civil War he commanded the First Minnesota Infantry Volunteers
        (April-October, 1861) until his promotion to brigadier general. Following his discharge from
        military service in 1864, he practiced law in St. Paul in partnership with Cushman K. Davis.
        In 1869 he was appointed St. Paul city attorney, and held that office until his death on May
        20, 1876.</p>

        <head id="a3">SCOPE AND CONTENTS OF THE RECORDS</head>
        <p>Subject files and correspondence of territorial governor Gorman. A large proportion
        relate to territorial officers' appointments and commissions. Letters received and sent
        address the following topics: concerns of federal civilian agencies, military and Indian
        affairs in general, the 1855 treaty with the Winnebago Indians, land sales, the Minnesota
        and Northwestern Railroad Company, and other territorial affairs. Also present are a
        legislative diary (Jan. 27-March 6, 1857), pardon records, petitions regarding local
        government organization, reports from territorial officers, and requests from other states
        for return of fugitives.</p>
        <p>Gorman's governorship spanned a period of both tangible and speculative growth in
        the state's infrastructure and economy, with numerous railroads, educational institutions,
        and corporations being chartered, new counties established, new towns incorporated, and
        several Indian treaties ratified. The surviving records contain only sketchy information on
        these developments, and do not appear to contain any significant documentation on an
        abortive 1857 scheme to remove the state capital from St. Paul to St. Peter.</p>
